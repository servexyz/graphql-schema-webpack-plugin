# Questions

- [ ] How often do we want to re-download our graphcool schema?
  - [ ] Is this something that we want to tie to specific compilation events? Or simply time?
  - [ ] Do we want to tie this to a specific CLI verb (e.g. "--graphql") ? 
- [ ] How do we want the user to be able to pass in the custom G.cool endpoint?
- [ ] Is there any privacy / endpoint considerations? My G.cool schema is public by default but not sure if that' standard or not
